# Creating Tables in Postgres

This exercise is very simple:

Create a `.sql` file that creates the tables needed to run the operational, normalized database you designed in the previous exercise ("normalizing"). In that exercise, you ended with some Pandas Dataframes that represented a normalized version of your data. Now you will write the `.sql` file that sets up a Postgres database to store data in that normalized format!

Thus you need to: 

1. Create a `.sql` file, call it whatever you want (i.e. `foo.sql` or `bar.sql`...). 

2. Write the queries to create the necessary tables in your normalized design for the data.

3. Commit the new `.sql` file and push it to the repo to turn in the assignment. 

You probably want to first go through the [tutorial.md](tutorial.md) file, which runs you through a tutorial on how to A) run a Postgres server B) connect to a Postgres server C) write SQL queries to create databases and tables and D) write those queries into a file and run that file against a server.
